**Car Price Prediction Model**

Developed a **Car Price Prediction Model** using **Random Forest Regression**, leveraging a dataset from Kaggle that includes essential car attributes such as **brand, model, year, engine type, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and price**.  

- **Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data distribution, detect outliers, and analyze feature correlations.  
- **Preprocessed the dataset** by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.  
- **Applied feature engineering** techniques to enhance model performance.  
- **Implemented a Random Forest Regression model** to predict car prices with high accuracy.  
- **Evaluated the model's performance** using metrics like **RÂ² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.  

This project strengthened my expertise in **machine learning, EDA, feature engineering, and predictive modeling** while deepening my understanding of **Random Forest Regression for real-world applications**.
